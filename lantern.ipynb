    "# Websites and APIs\n",
    "Web scraping and APIs are popular methods for collecting data from websites. **Webscraping** involves directly parsing a website's HTML, allowing extraction of a wide range of data available on a page. Webscraping, however, introduces complexity to a project, especially if the website's data is not consistently structured. **APIs** provide structured data and detailed documentation for querying the website and filtering results. They are generally easier to use but may come with restrictions, such as limits on the number of requests per day or the number of records you can retrieve. \n",
