0,patagonian-mara,Dolichotis patagonum,"The general form of Patagonian maras is that of a long-legged rodent with a body similar to a hoofed animal. Their coat is primarily grayish-brown, with a white patch along the chest and stomach and orange coloration around the flanks and head. It is darker toward the rump, with the exception of a bright white patch of hair that borders their hindquarters. Their coat is stiff, dense and very fine in texture. Patagonian maras have four toes on their front feet and three on their hind feet; each toe is equipped with strong claws. Their long ears, short tails and larger size set them apart from other species within the family Caviidae.","Patagonian maras average 27.5 inches (70 centimeters) in length, with a tail of 1.5 to 2 inches (4 to 5 centimeters). They weigh between 17.6 and 35.3 pounds (8 to 16 kilograms).","Patagonian maras inhabit central and southern Argentina. They prefer arid grasslands and brush lands with a great deal of open space. The home range of a mara pair can fluctuate greatly depending upon food availability; these drifting ranges typically amount to 242 acres (98 hectares). Maras move in a variety of ways. They may walk, hop in a rabbit-like fashion, gallop or stot — a unique form of locomotion typically exhibited by ungulates, where the animal bounces on all fours.","Patagonian maras may walk, hop in a rabbit-like fashion, gallop or stot — a unique form of locomotion typically exhibited by ungulates, where the animal bounces on all fours. These maras travel in mated pairs, with the male aggressively protecting his mate from rivals and predators.",Near threatened,Mammalia,Rodentia,Caviidae,Dolichotis patagonum,

2,false-water-cobra,Hydrodynastes gigas,"False water cobras grow to an impressive size and are one of the larger snakes found in South American floodplains. They are a diurnal species and can be considerably active throughout the day where they climb, burrow and swim. The most common name for this snake in its native range is ñacaniná (niyah-kah-nee-nah), which originates from the Guaraní people who inhabit Brazil, Paraguay, Bolivia and northern Argentina.
The false water cobra is named for its ability to flatten its neck to appear larger. This gives the snake the appearance of a cobra. However, unlike a true cobra, the false water cobra does not prop itself up vertically but maintains a horizontal position. This species can also flatten other areas of its body, while a true cobra cannot. 
These snakes are venomous, but the toxicity of their venom has not been thoroughly studied. If the human body is exposed to large enough quantities, the venom can inhibit blood clotting, cause swelling and create quite a bit of discomfort. The false water cobra does not have an injecting apparatus, as some snakes with fangs at the front of their mouths do. Instead, its fangs are located at the back of its mouth, and it has to chew its prey to inject its toxin.
The false water cobra is also lacking a large venom gland. Instead, it has a Duvernoy's gland, which is found in many rear-fanged snakes and is separate from the salivary gland. As such, saliva from these snakes is not toxic, but secretions from the Duvernoy's gland are. Because of these characteristics, when fending off predators or displaying aggression, adult false water cobras generally do not attempt to envenomate but instead bite with a slashing motion to inflict a wound.",The semi-aquatic false water cobra grows to an impressive size.,"The false water cobra is a neotropical snake found in southern Brazil, eastern Bolivia, Paraguay and northern Argentina. It is a terrestrial or semi-aquatic snake found in wet, tropical and humid habitats, often near streams or in the floodplains of rivers.","This species is named for its ability to flatten its neck to appear larger, resembling a cobra. The false water cobra is semi-aquatic and can climb, burrow and swim.",Not evaluated,Reptilia,Squamata,Colubridae,Hydrodynastes gigas,
3,elds-deer,Rucervus eldii,"Eld’s deer are known for the impressive bow or lyre shaped antlers of the males (stags), which sweep back in a single curve about 99 centimeters (39 inches) long. A smaller tine grows toward the front of the head and is especially noticeable. The antlers are shed every year and reach their largest size during the breeding season.
The imposing species has a very regal and graceful deer physique. Its legs are long and thin, and it has a long, slender body with a large head and ears. Their coats are rough, coarse and change color with the season. In summer, they are reddish-brown with paler underparts. In winter, their coats are dark brown. Stags tend to have darker coloring than hinds and possess a thick mane of long hair around the neck. The tail is short in length and the rump has no distinct patch. The antlers, bow - or lyre-shaped, tend to grow outward and then inward; a smaller branch grows toward the front of the head.",Males (stags) grow to about 180 centimeters (71 inches) and 125 to 175 kilograms (276 to 386 pounds). They are taller and larger than females (hinds) that stand 150 centimeters (59 inches) tall.,"The Eld’s deer is indigenous to Southeast Asia and was formerly widely distributed from the Manipur region of northeastern India through much of Myanmar, Thailand, Lao PDR, Cambodia and Vietnam to the island of Hainan, China, in the east. The deer inhabited suitable forest habitats, lowland valleys and plains, avoiding dense forests and coastal areas. Today, Eld’s deer occur in a number of protected areas throughout their former range.
Local projects have helped raise public awareness and support for conserving the deer. Hainan Datian Nature Reserve on Hainan Island, China, was established in 1976 specifically to help the brow-antlered deer recover, with the population now growing an average of 15 percent annually. This population has grown so large, in fact, that Eld’s deer have been translocated to other parts of the island, and a community education project was initiated to raise local awareness about the plight of the deer and the protected status of the sanctuary. Managed populations exist around the world, but inbreeding is common, and cooperative cross-breeding is required if managed populations are to be genetically varied enough for any future reintroduction programs into the wild.","Male Eld's deer are offered large jolly balls during rutting season. They spend a lot of time pushing the balls around with their antlers, much like they would trees and shrubs in the wild.  Eld's deer breeding season is triggered by day length. The deer breed in the spring when day length increases, unlike white-tailed deer that breed in the fall as day length shortens.",Endangered,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Cervidae,Rucervus eldii,
4,black-throated-blue-warbler,Setophaga caerulescens,"Males have a dark blue back with black sides on head, throat and breast. The underside is bright white. Females have an olive back and pale olive to buff undersides. Both males and females have a white square (or ""pocket handkerchief"") on their wings.Males show variation in plumage coloration on their backs that does not appear to have a strong genetic basis. Birds in the southern Appalachian mountains have blue back with black streaks, whereas northern breeders tend to have solid blue backs.","Adults are 4.3-5.1 inches (11-13 centimeters) long, and weigh about 0.3-0.4 ounces (8-12 grams).","Black-throated blue warblers prefer interiors of hardwood forests, with thick, tangled vegetation. During migration, they can be found in all sorts of woodlands and in parks and gardens.During the winter, they inhabit dense forest, woodlands, shade-grown coffee plantations and second growth areas with trees. One study in Puerto Rico showed males were more common at lower and mid-level forests and females were found in shrubbier habitat higher up.","They are easily identifiable by their buzzy ""zoo-zoo-zoo-zee"" song. Males and females look radically different and were originally described as two separate species.",Least concern,Aves,Passeriformes,Parulidae,Setophaga caerulescens,
