LTN19781023-01.2.24,Whose homecoming,ARTICLE+ILLUSTRATION,23 October 1978,"<p dir=""auto"">Whose homecoming</p><p dir=""auto"">For the first time in years, homecoming was a big event at Qfeip S^afet ? c We had green laser lights dancing on the buildings of downtown Columbus. We had a bonfire and the traditional school spirit cheers. We had Bob Hope as the grand marshal of the homecoming parade. In what must be heralded as an innovative community spirit gesture, the parade started downtown. Unfortunately, it also ended downtown. This denied many students in the university area the chance to see the floats, the homecoming king and queen candidates and the celebrated comedian. The parade, which was well organized and certainly starstudded in the downtown sense, was mismanaged as far as the university angle is concerned. This was, after all, Ohio State's homecoming. It was not a salute</p><p dir=""auto"">to Bob Hope. It was not a celebration of Ohio Theatre's golden jubHee.-R'was not organized so ""that NBC could film Hope for a December ""Bob Hope Salutes the Ohio Jubilee"" special. As mentioned before, the homecoming committee should be commended for making homecoming an event of importance in a school where student apathy is well known. However, by holding the parade entirely downtown instead of at least partly in the campus area, the parade was performed more for the benefit of Bob Hope and the Ohio Theatre than for the students and alumni which homecoming supposedly represents. The idea of having the parade enter the downtown area is a good one. Perhaps next year, the homecoming parade will be equally festive for both the campus and downtown areas.</p><p dir=""auto"">YA KNOW W, THIN© C0W.P BE WORSE - WE COVLp HAVE REEN STOCK IN HERE WITH A REPORTER,,,</p>"

Last year. Bob Hope was grand marshal of the OSU Homecoming parade, held in downtown Columbus.

But the committee turned the proposal down to focus on bringing Homecoming back to campus to enable more students to participate, he said. Once they decided to focus on a campuswide Homecoming, the committee researched expanding Homecoming to include more activities and to obtain additional publicity. The committee tried to obtain a single sponsor to get more money, but Kelleher said they realized the use of a single sponsor for a campus event such as Homecoming might turn into a commercial stunt.

LTN19781020-01.2.30,'50s homecomings more 'involved',ARTICLE+ILLUSTRATION,20 October 1978,"<p dir=""auto"">'50s homecomings more 'involved'</p><p dir=""auto"">By Jean Kinney Homecomings during the fifties may not have attracted celebrities like Bob Hope, but they were still ""the event of fall quarter. Everybody got involved in it, even the town people,"" said Shiela Castellarin, class of '58 and presently director of community services at Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc. And there was no need to import celebrities back then because homecoming made them. Laurie Fant, homecoming queen for the 1955-56 school year, spent a quarter studying in Mexico, and discovered herself listed in the registrar's bureau there as ""Ohio State's football queen,"" according to a Lantern of that period. The 1956 homecoming court of 10 women were guests on radio shows and were treated to dinner and dancing at several Columbus restaurants. The homecoming queen was chosen through a campus-wide election and a typical pre-election day for the 1956 court was spent ""riding about in top-down, horn-tooting convertibles,"" said a contemporary Lantern.</p><p dir=""auto"">The candidates would take their campaign skits on a tour of the fraternity houses and dorms, and there was a ""traditional parade of queen finalists around the Oval"" on the day the winner was to be announced, said Lantern clippings. There was no parade with floats then, said Henry ""Butch"" O'Neill, class of '57 and now chief executive officer of Beverage Management Inc. in Columbus. Instead sororities and fraternities decorated their houses. ""We started planning decorations weeks ahead, and would try to pick someone in engineering or architecture to plan it,"" said O'Neill. ""One year our theme was</p><p dir=""auto"">'It's in the bag,' (a football victory) and we got our whole fraternity house in a giant paper bag we'd made. Half an hour before the judging, a big wind came along and destroyed the whole thing,"" recalled O'Neill. One sorority house's decoration was called ""Uncork a victory"" and featured a 16-foot bottle of champagne, according to Lantern clippings. Homecoming publicity treated the occasion as a combination beauty contest-royal gala event. ""Her Majesty Reigns Tonight,"" announced a large Lantern headline about the queen of 1956's homecoming dance. ""It really was a beauty contest, but nobody re-</p><p dir=""auto"">sented it. It was a good thing to be recognized for your appearance,"" said Castellarin. In the sixties and early seventies, when student activism took off in directionslike civil rights and peace demonstrations, homecoming was left behind. But a slow process of ""trying to build homecoming up to its proper perspective"" is underway, said Cindy Englefield, a senior from Granview and this year's homecoming committee chairperson. The committee is working at getting the court, now five men and five women, more exposure, she said. The court this year attended some alumni functions and is planning to visit Children's Hospital. But homecoming contestants seem to agree that returning to the event's status held in the fifties would be undesirable. ""If we represent the student body, why should we be treated like royalty?"" said homecoming contestant Holly Stefanyk, a junior from Ashland. ""I feel pride for being on the court, but I hate being introduced as a member of the court. I just want to be introduced to people as myself,"" said Ron Broomall, a senior from Exton, Penn.</p><p dir=""auto"">Lantern File Photo 1959 Homecoming Court</p>"

The new mobility for the 24 floats was the idea of the Centennial Students' Steering Committee , who ""wanted to do something different this year because of it being Centennial year , "" according to committee chairman Eric Grulke . Grulke , a senior from Berea , said the committee decided to have the mobile floats instead of the ""traditional stationary floats built in front of dorms and fraternity houses . "" The general theme of homecoming , ""Dawning of the Age , "" will be illustrated by floats with a social comment , according to Grulke . Of the 24 floats , Grulke said , "" some will be the typical 'Rah ! Rah ! ' floats , but most will be pertaining to social conditions .

Reed Varian , a senior from East Canton , "" came up with the idea for a United Appeal float and has done a great deal of work on it , "" Grulke said . This year ' s floats will cost less to build than in the past , according to Grulke , ""in recent years , some groups have spent over $ 1 , 000 to construct a float . This year the floats will only cost $ 200- $ 300 to build , because they ' re small .

LTN19731102-01.2.21,G & iWCIiff s Homecoming notes ,ARTICLE,2 November 1973,"<p dir=""auto"">G &amp; iWCIiff s Homecoming notes</p><p dir=""auto"">It ' s about time somebody investigated Homecoming weekend at Ohio State . While reflecting on last weekend , I came to realize just how badly students are exploited on this campus . Face it , Homecoming is just an excuse for the Student Event Board ( SEB ) to plan three movies at the Ohio Union and hold a parade . The concert is certainly not its responsibility , thanks to OSU Pop Concerts . Why do students have to pay for projects like floats that only benefit the non-student fans in the crowd and not the students themselves ? Dorms , fraternities , sororities and the like spent their own money — student money — to support a project mainly aimed toward non-students and alumni . Let the alumni pay for the materials and other costs for that weekend if they want it so badly . Why do we need an excuse to congregate for entertainment ? Couldn't the money for those floats be used forbetterdorm facilities or even for charity ? Let our ex-graduates dig through their own resources and treat the students to a weekend . At least when we become alumni , we'll know what Homecoming is really supposed to be . Whv should Homecoming be retained</p><p dir=""auto"">when the people who pay for it — students — never benefit from it . Sure , we get to pay for the movies and the concert . We pay — they don ' t . If the alumni and the administration want Homecoming so badly , why not solicit donations the same way they solicit contributions to the University sponsored United Way ? When it comes down to a choice between allocating $ 200 for a Homecoming float that will be used once a year or a $ 200 ping-pong table for your dorm , which would you take ? In the area of Homecoming , in which the students should be allowed to participate , SEB flunked out . Their biggest mistake centered around the process of choosing the homecoming queen . Though I congratulate Ms . Firestone , I ' m getting a little tired ( excuse the pun ) of having no say on this campus . Why couldn't students have chosen their own ""sex symbol ? "" Admittedly , the title is so contrived and irrelevant , but at least we could have had some voice in her selection . It ' s been said that if students were again allowed to vote for the queen , they may elect a man . Wouldn't that either show the mentality of Ohio State students or the absurdity of choosing a Homecoming queen ?</p><p dir=""auto"">Cliff Gold</p><p dir=""auto"">Anyway , SEB could still limit the field with their ""select"" panel of campus leaders . If they insist on a queen , why not give them a forum in The Lantern similar to the platform synopsis afforded each candidate for Undergraduate Student Government office ? That way , they could prove that a girl with good looks may also be intelligent . SEB failed last weekend because they forgot to let the students get involved . ( Remember , we pay the bill . ) It was a great</p><p dir=""auto"">idea to use ""Color My World' as he Homecoming theme , but not telling ""Chicago "" that itf song was the theme is incomprehensible I ' m sure that had they been told , the song would have been played . All in all , it was a typical Ohio State Homecoming . Woody ran up the score as everybody screamed for more . But next year , I suggest the SEB abandon Homecoming if the students have to pay the hi"" - .,. „ u Why not pick a weekend in February ( can you think of a more worthless month ?) , plan a parade to a basketball pep rally on the Oval show three free movies at the Ohio Union and offer the students a free concert . At least that way , students benefit directly from the function of SEB . No queens , no floats and no synthetic atmosphere will be unveiled on a Saturday afternoon . If the alumni want Homecoming , let them pay for it . We'll build their floats and pick their queens . Nobody ' s against a good time , but I'd rather play ping-pong for a year than build a stationary float for one day .</p>"

The contest will be judged on the appearance and any behavior which the</p><p dir=""auto"">clown or group of clowns think is funny, Kelleher said. Prizes will be awarded for the funniest, most original and best allaround clowns. Dorm participation in Homecoming events has increased through the entry of nine dorms in the float competition. Only one dorm entered the float competition last year. Signs and floats are being made for competition in the rally and parade to be held this weekend. A new award, the spirit award, will be given this year to encourage pride in OSU, Kelleher said. One spirit award will be given to the dorm with the most vocal supporters at Homecoming events. The other award will be given to whomever shows the most support of OSU through participation in any of the Homecoming activities, he said.

In 1941, Homecoming was a major event on campus. Homecoming Queen candidates were sponsored by student political groups such as the Ohio Students Party Associates, Scarlet and Gray, and the All Campus Combine. The Lantern listed the finalists and recorded the number of votes each received, and their pictures filled the front page. Homecoming campaigns included banners, posters and students wearing sandwich signs in support of their candidates. Campaign expenditures could not exceed $25. Other activities consisted of a contest between dormitories, fraternities, sororities and other student organizations for the best house decoration, and the traditional Homecoming Dance, where the name of the queen was announced. A major department store advertised a dress for the dance that would ""set the world on fire"" and ""start a flame in THAT college man's heart."" In 1950, the Student Senate handled the Homecoming Queen elections and the many regulations were</p><p dir=""auto"">presented in the Lantern. No campaign publicity was permitted on campus, unlike previous years. Each candidate presented a skit at rallies sponsored by the Student Senate elections committee, and only 10 campaign posters for each contestant were allowed. The dance offered ""smooth and swing music"" and the house decoration contest and rally still existed. Sororities with candidates serenaded the fraternities for votes. In the early 60s the traditional rally, decoration contest and dance were continued. Stan Kenton provided the entertainment in 1961, and a bonfire and parade were added. By the end of the last decade, homecdming was still front-page news, and the activities were much the same, but again something new was added. Besides the traditional queen, a black Homecoming queen was chosen. Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears performed at the 1969 dance. This year, the Homecoming Dance features the band ""Disco King"" and beer. For the '70s, Homecoming King has been added to the agenda, and will be crowned along with the queen at pre-game tomorrow.</p>"

At a school the size of this university , the majority of the students never have seen or heard of the members of the homecoming queen court and most could not care less who those selected beauties are . The Homecoming Committee should have taken a hint from the student body which year after year has refused to vote in any significant numbers for queen candidates . ""The response has been so bad we changed the voting so that a panel of judges picks the court now , "" Eldon Plummer . co-chairman of the 1973 Homecoming Committee , said . Changing the manner of selecting the court does not change the fact that the contest basically boils down to a cheap ego trip for a couple hundred contestants . At many small colleges , the contestants are known by practically all of the</p><p dir=""auto"">student body and the contest is anxiously awaited because of the meaning it has for students . But at a huge university such as Ohio State , the contestants are unknown and the contest has little if any meaning to the school . The contest itself has gone sexless , as males were allowed to enter last year for the first time . Two men did , but neither was fortunate enough to make the queen ' s court . If a male does win the coveted title he will still be hailed as "" queen . "" Colleges and universities across the nation have elected cows , pigs and males to point out that the practice of selecting one woman to reign over a day ' s festivities is really a laughing matter .

Moore , a 1933 Ohio State graduate , has seen many homecomings and has gathered his impressions of activities then and now . Something about homecoming week in and around Buckeye Land gets into one ' s blood stream . Unforgettable , you mean ? Visualize October ' s golden leaves floating lazily down from high branches . Trees , like blazing fires , under blue , cloudless skies . Those chrysanthemums and marigolds along the Oval . Then laurel and old rose bushes . Then the Buckeye band , the floats and the homecoming parade . Finally , the climactic game</p><p dir=""auto"">— Badgers versus Bucks . This year it ' s difficult to gel a better setting for homecoming week . Besides , the Bucks are Number 1 and aiming to stay that way . And those fraternities and sorority houses and the people — they'll all be out trying out newer designs for floats or dragging out older versions for repair and newer ideas . Don't overlook "" nostalgia "" — a nameless something difficult to pinpoint . All the same , the ""thing"" is there . One gets the ""feel of homecoming"" with old grads coming back after long absences , the chatting of oldtimers , or maybe dropping by for open house at your favorite place . Maybe a visit with a house mother , someone you neglected to write .</p><p dir=""auto"">IT COULD be a person like ""Mom"" Hayes , house mother over at Alpha Zeta , agricultural fraternity house , 14 th and Indianola . Listening to this lady's experiences in and around Buckeye land is contagious . But the fellows , year in and yea "" r * out , come back for a chat with Mom Hayes . She will tell you a thing or two about the "" good Old days . "" For Mom Hayes it has been 26 years of service at five different fraternities . She was brought into Alpha Zeta just this year , but — the lady</p><p dir=""auto"">added herself — she wouldn't have changed any of it . At the point of leaving , Mom was the escort out to the front hallway to show a large silver plaque which had been given to her by the boys recently . The silver plaque with names in large letters for Mom was in recognition of 25 years of service and devotion to frat boys in her charge . She could be elected ""homecoming queen mother"" in any showdown of popularity . One gets the 'feel of homecoming' with old grads coming back</p><p dir=""auto"">About homecoming , Mom rambled on , ""The boys do anything I ask without question . They willingly divide up work among themselves , keep things organized . If the house needs anything , all I need to do is ask . "" Mom Hayes glowed when she retold how lads in one fraternity she served helped out in an unusual manner when Xenia ' s tornado struck . They had great spirit , she said , and are ambitious in anything they do . She spoke about old Ohio Field of the Chick Harley days and of the first homecoming crowds in the shadow of the newly built Ohio stadium in 1921 . OVER AT THE Phi Kappa</p><p dir=""auto"">Tau House , members were found preparing for the Annual Pumpkin Sale starting Oct . 16 . It is a goodwill venture with proceeds set aside for purchase of a dog for a needy blind lad . Each fraternity cooperates with a sorority with specific girls entered in the pumpkin queen contest . A promotion idea — anyone who buys a pumpkin becomes eligible to vote for a girl in this contest . As the Pi Betta Phi sorority on Indianola , girls are still talking about their success last year of getting four girls on homecoming court . They are still elated that any of at least three girls could have been elected queen last fall . Such success whets the ' 75 selection for queen . When the subject of floats for the ' 75 parade came up , a bystander noted there is ""less secretiveness"" in the planning and designs this year . Getting fellows started early enough to meet deadlines for completion is still a big problem , he said . At the Phi Delta Theta fraternity on luka , Don Huline is chairman of a homecoming committee . He believes that ""homecoming pranks"" are dying off . ""The fellows here and at other houses are terribly busy and actually more serious minded about their homecoming chores , "" Huline declared .</p><p dir=""auto"">IT IS A WEEK of great expectations over at Pi Beta Phi . Open house will be the main emphasis . They have a girl named for homecoming queen — Marilyn Doyle . They will have a big float using chrysanthemums , and while working with Beta Theta Pi on it , there may be bouquets to spare . Could you come up with some new idea about</p><p dir=""auto"">""elected queens ? "" Back in 1925 , a Buckeye homecoming committee hauled out one — most unusual to say the least . That year , during Farmer ' s Week , a champion cow , Maudine Ormsby , was elected queen . She beat out a court of 10 beautiful girls for that prize . The 1925 Makio carries the story and with it a picture of the select cow alongwith that of Ex-Governor Frank Lowden of Illinois who was visiting here . And on the next page , there is another picture of Maudine at the center of a cattle judging clinic . For 1929 the Mardi Gras parade was a principal highlight homecoming week . Thirty-six floats were entered , the whole being led by the queen and the strutting Ohio State band . That same day Queen Ethel Husselman took a little ride in the Goodyear blimp ""Defender "" ( blimps are bigger now ) and landed at Ohio Stadium shortly before the game . Speaking of old year books , maybe you've noticed how Makios have handled Back in 1925 , a champion cow was elected queen</p><p dir=""auto"">homecoming events over the last half-century . You'll find the older ones over at Main Library , second floor , along with other treasured legends and traditions of Ohio State University .</p><p dir=""auto"">THE MAKIO of 1932 , through the medium of photos , provides a panorama of Ohio ' s homecoming traditions . Interesting they are , though perhaps many have fallen in discard over the years . One picture in the 1932 Makio has well-known Bill North billed on the same page with the Ohio Champion relay team of the same year . But the stadium is the background and you see crowds arriving for the ""big game . "" You'll see a picture of Wesley Fesler stepping down from the rostrum — presumably under the stadium where a banquet had been held . In 1931 , 44 years ago this fall , a heavily favored , strong</p><p dir=""auto"">Wisconsin Badger team came to the stadium to play the Buckeyes . The homecoming game turned out to be a defensive fight all the way . Most of the game the Buckeyes outbattled the Badgers . Yet something was missing — that final drive that scores touchdowns . Today , old-timers will be able to recite names of those battlers — fellows like Bob Horn , Bill Bell , Lew Hinchman , Wesley Fesler , Marty Varner and many others . Late in the game Fesler was forced to leave the game because of an injury . You could see the Ail-American back and end limping to the bench , head hanging , tearfully , one of those climaxes about homecoming never to be forgotten . HOMECOMING PLANS I</p><p dir=""auto"">give the local alumni association plenty of opportunity to help plan and carry out homecoming activities . Plans are made for one evening and the following day and evening , supposedly Friday evening and Saturday afternoon and evening . Old folks : beware of taking long rides with lower classmen</p><p dir=""auto"">On Friday there may be an alumni banquet to which all alumnus — wives and husbands — are invited . The banquet location will have to be planned locally ; it may be in a church , a club , a hotel or just about anywhere . Tickets are usually sold a week in advance and at the time of sale , the purchaser and the date of his graduation should be registered . This warning is to seniors and old grads , old folks who</p><p dir=""auto"">were the original instigators of abductions for long rides , the Friday night pie fights , and other tomfoolery victimized on incoming Freshmen . Now the shoe is on the other foot . Beware of taking long rides with unknown lower classmen . You could wind up stranded at some desolate predecided place without benefit of any money . Besides , you might not be able to make it back in town for the ""Big Game"" come Satur</p><p dir=""auto"">day . One warning should be sufficient . IN DAYS GONE by ""Senior Rides"" were a tradition of Alpha Gamma Rho with seniors the usual victims of ""long rides . "" One ofthe rules of such rides was upper classmen were not allowed to be taken out of Ohio ; but since Kelly's Island was still part of Ohio , several of them found themselves stranded there . Getting back to home base added to the anxiety .</p>"

At Capital University , the festivities begin four days before the Oct . 18 homecoming . Tim Philabaul , homecoming chairman , said the week before homecoming is highlighted with square dancing , jazz bands and a huge outdoor barbecue for all the students . Students' spirits are further heightened , Philabaul said , by cancelling of classes the Friday afternoon before the game with a bonfire and pep rally later in the evening . Capital University will host Mount Union College for the game . Homecoming queens of the past 25 years will be featured at that time . THE FESTIVITIES will close with a semi-formal dance that night . Charles Renner , a junior from Dunkirk , said , ""There is definitely a lot of student enthusiasm at Capital , especially with the freshmen . "" Steve Tymer , a senior from Columbus , said , ""When people at Ohio State think of homecoming , they think football and not much else . But at Capital the football team is not the dominating part of homecoming . At Capital we put more emphasis on the homecoming ceremony and the greeting ofthe alumni .

The homecoming queen will be crowned during the halftime of Otterbein ' s game against Wooster College , Carpelloti added . A buffet dinner for the students and an informal dance will follow the game and end the celebration . Carpellotti added , ""The homecoming always generates a lot of student enthusiasm here . The students really think it ' s great . "" BOB BUCHAN , a senior from Columbus , thinks the size ofthe school is what makes the students get more involved in the homecoming . ""Since we are just a small school , everybody knows everybody else . Because of this everyone does all they can to make a good homecoming . Also , since everyone knows who the queen candidates are and see them almost every day , there are more people that vote for homecoming queen , "" he said . Beatrice Stephens , director of alumni affairs for Dennison University , said , ""The enthusiasm is just phenomenal . I ' ve never seen so much of it . "" Even though their campus women ' s liberation organizations have put an end to the ceremony of electing a homecoming queen , they are still expecting a large number of alumni to return to see the Oct . 25 homecoming football game with Muskingum College .</p>"

To eliminate the emphasis on Greek participation in campus traditions , candidates for May Queen and Homecoming Queen in 1969 were not allowed to publicize their sorority or organization affiliations . May Queen dropped The board succeeded in having all classes instead of only afternoon ones cancelled for May Day activities , and in 1970 the group eliminated May Queen altogether and put a greater emphasis on service activities instead of fun during May Week . The 1971 May Week ,</p><p dir=""auto"">planned despite the threat of a repeat of the Spring Quarter 1970 disturbances , included tutoring projects , a clean-up of off-campus alleys , a carnival , a rock concert , bed races and a speech by U . S . Sen . George McGovern , D-S . D . Homecoming has also been simplified . Greek houses , living units and dorms no longer compete for prizes won via elaborate and costly house donations . Many sororities and fraternities donate the $ 300 they might spend to decorate their lawn to a charity while others enter moveable floats in a Homecoming parade , a 1971 innovation .</p><p dir=""auto"">For coeds only The Homecoming Queen is no longer selected by a University-wide campaign featuring skits and a talent competition . Candidates fill out a questionnaire screened by a panel of persons not affiliated with the University who eventually select five contestants .</p><p dir=""auto"">The origins of Homecoming and May Week have been obscured by the changes . Originally May Day was a stately affair for coeds only . The first May Day was sponsored in 1909 by the Women ' s Student Council and was climaxed when senior women dressed as nymphs , raindrops , clouds and the wind danced the minuet in Mirror Lake Hollow . By the 1920 ' s men joined the festivities then known as Traditions Week which cli</p><p dir=""auto"">Ugly Man</p><p dir=""auto"">maxed in 1925 when police armed with blackjacks were called to Bucket and Dipper ( junior men ' s honorary ) initiations when some members tried to throw unwilling freshmen into Mirror Lake . Queen cow The May Week Auction , discontinued in the 1960 s , featured the "" sale"" of University officials to students , such as John T . Bonner , vice president for educational services .</p><p dir=""auto"">whose services as a butler were once purchased for $ 26 . Homecoming highlights include 1926 when Maudine Ormsby , a prize Holstein cow from the agriculture college , was named queen and later disqualified . In 1935 elections were confused , too . when Rosina Dienlein and her identical twin Mary ran for queen . Agnes Heskett won and several law students threatened to abduct her when their proposal tc have queen candidates parade across tables in the library was overruled by the Administration . A la Miss America Dad ' s Day , a football Saturday when one student ' s father is the special guest ol</p><p dir=""auto"">the University , was changed to Parents' Weekend in 1969 . Formerly , students wrote essays of 25 words or less on why their fathers should be selected for the honor , but the event was enlarged to include invitations for all parents to attend the special game and the essay contest was eliminated . Another campus tradition , Golddiggers King , was also eliminated in 1969 . Dating back to 1936 this annual winter dance featured coeds buying the dance and dinner tickets , opening doors and escorting their boyfriends home . Everything from slide rules to vegetables to false teeth was used by coeds to</p><p dir=""auto"">construct corsages for their dates . Once only an all-girl affair called the ""Coed Prom , "" three boys crashed the event in 1915 and a tradition was born . It soon died as elaborate election procedures for selecting the handsomest male on campus sprang up , including talent contests and personality interviews a la Miss America . Demented Duck Golddigger competition in 1968 , the last year before the tradition was dropped because of lack of interest , included skits ""highlighted "" by Robert Musson ' s sixminute monologue on the reactions of a new night watchman as King Kong</p><p dir=""auto"">climbs up the outside of the Empire State Building . While handsome Golddigger kings have been dropped from campus tradition , the annual Ugly Man On Campus contest , sponsored by Alpha Phi Omega service fraternity to aid area charities , fares much better . Young men transformed into hideous monsters via silly putty , paint , false noses and wigs stalk the campus grabbing unsuspecting coeds and demanding a donation for their favorite charity . This year such uglies as Gutter Snipe , Captain America , Tommy Trustee , Greasy Rider , Hairy Question and Demented Duck raised $ 2 , 100 for charity .</p><p dir=""auto"">May Week</p>"

Soft winds gently pull the brightly-colored leaves from the trees and carefully guide them to the ground where they pile up , just waiting for a child to come rustling through ; delighting in the noise he can make by scattering the leaves in the wind once again . It is very pleasant to be outside in Autumn . So pleasant that I almost didn't mind waiting in line in front of my favorite bar last night . As I walked to the back , I noticed someone gesturing to me from a booth . I have received many gestures in bars but this one was friendly and the person seemed to be signaling for me to join him . I moved closer and saw it was my old friend and self-avowed victim ofthe welfare state , Sylvester P . Sullivan . ""Well Sully , it's good to see you're still up and about , "" I said . ""But since when do you sit in a booth ?"" ""I HAD AN unfortunate experience re</p><p dir=""auto"">Andrew Sailer</p><p dir=""auto"">cently which forced me to give up stools , "" Sylvester replied .

""You mean because ofthe beautiful Autumn days we've been having ? "" I responded . ""No , no , "" he angrily replied . ""Haven't you seen all the frenzied activity on fraternity and sorority row . ""WELL , I'VE SEEN some people dragging around dead animals and a lot of people standing around in the front yards on 15 th , but nothing really out ofthe ordinary , "" I said . Sully chose to ignore my nastiness and still looked quite enthused over the ""social event ofthe season"" so I gave in and asked if there were many events planned for homecoming . ""You wouldn't believe what a great lineup they ' ve got for us this year , "" he said , nearly bubbling over with enthusiasm , or was he bubbling over with beer ? Sylvester continued , ""Why , starting Friday afternoon there is going to be a dedication to All-America football players . That will be at Buckeye Grove . ""</p><p dir=""auto"">""THAT SOUNDS nice , "" I mumbled , thinking again of how pretty the trees are in October . ""And then Friday night there is gonna be a parade . I hear they expect as many as 40 to 50 people to show up for that . "" ""Wow , 40 to 50 people , "" I said in amazement . ""That ' s the biggest rally we've had around here for a long time . I hope the police don't find out about it . They'll probably arrest everyone for unlawful assembly . "" ""No , it's cool , "" Sully assured me . ""I think they got a permit . Besides Woody will square everything with the cops if there is any trouble . I mean , it ' s his parade so he wouldn't let the law mess it up , right ?"" ""Sure , sure . So what else is on the agenda ? "" I asked . I didn't really care but I found I got more drinking done if Sully did most ofthe talking . Sully grabbed a quick gulp from his bottle and said , ""I've also heard that after the third showing of the movie , Doc Turner will be conducting a special remedial lecture for the culturally deprived or anyone else who didn't understand the films . "" ""Super . I suppose there will be a queen and all that , "" I said . ""Definitely . What would homecoming be without a queen ?"" AFTER A LONG pause for thirst quenching I asked , ""Just what is homecoming anyway ?"" ""That's when all the alumni come back to see their school again and get drunk and pretend they're college kids again , "" Sully explained . ""Of course for a lot of recent graduates homecoming isn't very important . "" he added .</p><p dir=""auto"">""Why not ? Aren't they filled with school spirit ?"" ""It's not that , "" Sully said .

""Well , I don't like it , and you can write that down . "" Your name , please . ""My name isn't important .

Then they try to tear down University Hall and put chicken franchises all up and down High Street in place of the old campus hangouts . I don't like what they ' re doing . They ? I asked . ""Yeah , they . All these super-cool people who've got to change everything to make it relevant . The ones who throw out tradition but don't have anything to put in its place .

""I think they changed Homecoming because they were afraid to plan anything elaborate like last spring ' s May Week that might get canceled because of student disturbances . You have only yourselves to blame for all the changes that've been made . If you'd buckle down and study instead of sitting on the Oval chanting , America would still have her traditions intact .

The girl in the plaid pantsuit excused herself and hurried down 15 th Avenue saying , ""I really have nothing more to say , "" leaving the two young men , one in a business suit and the other in jeans , arguing loudly on the corner .

The document to be voted upon is called the Student-Faculty Proposals for Student Representation in the Governance of the School of Social Work . A committee composed of undergraduates , graduates and faculty spent the summer drafting the proposal . Representation varies The nine Program Committees would vary in number of student representatives from three to six members . James O . Billups , assistant director of the School of Social Work , said that only two or three faculty members would be on each of these committees . This would give a clear majority of students on each committee . In addition to student representation on committees , a Student Assembly would be formed by elected students from all committees . A total of 53 students would comprise the Assembly . Although students will have more than 50 per cent representation on</p><p dir=""auto"">committees , decisions should be arrived at by consensus . This hope was expressed by Milton S . Rosner , professor of Social Work and a member of the committee which drafted the proposal . Two main groups If the vote is affirmative , students will elect representatives to committees in two main groups : Sequence and Program . Sequence deals with curricula and Program with school policy . Rosner called it ""pluralistic decision making . He thinks that a proposal would be solved in one of the Sequence or Program Committees . Because of the variety of committees and the flexibility in the system to create even more committees , Rosner does not feel that a stand off between the Student Assembly and the Committee of Faculty will occur . Plan is realistic ""It ' s more realistic than a 50-50 representation , "" said Stanley Szalak , a graduate student from Lancaster , Pa . Gary Logan , a graduate from Columbus and a member of the Drafting Committee , said that if the vote were affirmative it would not be a constitution , but an operating document for all .</p><p dir=""auto"">Logan , and Kay Smith , a senior from Columbus , think that the only concern that might defeat the Proposal would be students' skepticism . ""It may seem too good to be true , "" Logan said . Richard R . Medhurst , director of the School of Social Work , said that previous student recommendations for representation "" were not structured . "" Student input allowed Medhurst said this is a system ""that will allow student inputs into all areas of the School of Social Work . The system is cumbersome , but that's the price of involvement , "" he said . Medhurst said there is a need for student involvement in all levels of the University and he feels the University is moving in this direction . Marlene Deutsch , a senior from New York and a participant in last Spring ' s strike against the school , said ""It will work if students take an interest in it .

The Ohio Theater, in honor of its 50th anniversary, is putting on the Jubilee Gala Performance Oct. 21, starring Bob Hope and other entertainers to be announced by the NBC network next week. NBC is taping the show to be nationally televised Dec. 3. Ohio State's homecoming festivities are also getting in on the act and both events are sharing the theme ""Thanks for the Memories,"" in honor of Hope and the theater. Hope and the other Jubilee stars will ride in the homecoming parade, its first time downtown, in antique cars. Press coverage of the Jubilee events will come from as far as Australia and London, said Clive David, who is planning the Jubilee. David also helped plan President Kennedy's birthday party in 1962 and brought off Israel's 25th anniversary celebration. Plans for the Jubilee began two years ago when David was in Columbus as part of a lecture series. He</p><p dir=""auto"">was asked to plan the Ohio Theater's Jubilee and agreed because he'd ""never seen a place like this (the theater),"" he said Tuesday at a press conference. Ten years ago the theater's future looked bleak when a developing company bought it with plans to tear ft down. A group of citizens formed the ""Save the Ohio Theatre Committee"" which attracted the attention of major Columbus foundations. Together they chipped in $1.8 million to buy the theater, said Don Streibit, executive director</p><p dir=""auto"">of the Ohio Theater. Now it has been declared a national historic landmark by the Department of the Interior, and ""on level with the White House."" David said. ""It's been the most difficult event I've ever attempted,"" David said, because of Columbus' lack of large public-gathering facilities. He called it ""the impossible dream come true."" It will take the theater 10 days to prepare for the Jubilee, David said. In addition to the stars and their staffs, NBC is bringing in over 100 crew members and set designers, he said.</p>"

A chubby brown nut called Brutus Buckeye with rabbit fur eyebrows and no hat was ""reborn"" for the homecoming parade, said Block ""O"" equipment manager Mark Wellman, a sophomore from Delphos. People along the parade route on High Street near the bandstand flocked around to have photographs taken with the copy of the original Brutus, said Brian Coady, a senior from</p><p dir=""auto"">Columbus and one of two people inside the newly built frame. The original Brutus, who was kidnapped several limes, painted maize and blue once and replaced twice by the Athletic Department, disappeared last year, Wellman said. The block designed the copy from photographs of the original that was retired by the Athletic Department autumn quarter 1977. Coady said the original ""disappeared"" sometime last year and he said mem-</p><p dir=""auto"">bers suspect Brutus was destroyed. The Athletic Department would not give Block ""O 'permission to bring the copy of the old nut into the stadium Saturday, ""because only one Brutus is allowed on the field at one time,"" a spokesperson for the department said. Block ""O"" officers stressed that their ""hero"" is not meant to compete with the department's new buckeye. The Athletic Department first tried to retire the original Brutus, which was created from fiberglass in</p><p dir=""auto"">1965.The replacement was a distorted mask, which, according to tfie Block ""O"" scrapbook, looked quite similar to the Purdue Boilermaker mascot. The original Brutus sneaked into the stadium after the replacement had been mascot at two games.

Shriver IOWA CITY, IOWA — Norman Rockwell couldn't have painted a more typical All-American setting for Ohio State's 27-6 win over the Iowa Hawkeyes. A colorful, crisp autumn afternoon in the heart of the cornbelt... homecoming.. .guys buying corsages for their gals (and hip flasks for themselves).. .pep rallies. ..bon fires., a parade. ..speeches by coaches and players extolling on the vi rtues of this Great American Game. It was all there. But for all its wonderland trappings, there were some elements surrounding the contest which can only be termed. ..unusual, from an Ohio State standpoint. For example, the Buckeye offense, lacking its characteristic sharpness, fumbled the ball five times, losing four, had several bungled plays and failed to score from the Iowa one-yard line on four consecutive, trys. Most unusual. Then, following the game, reporters were allowed' to roam at will through the Ohio State dressing room, free to worm deep secrets'from unprotected players. Highly unusual. Finally, when the members of the press had tracked down Woody Hayes in his dressing stall and began demanding an evaluation of his team's performance, the silver-haired figure sat there in his boxer shorts unconcerned, and answered in almost complacent terms. ""There is always some inconsistency,'' he said when asked about the fumbles, ""but we moved the ball. Four hundred and sixty-four yards, that's not too bad. We're getting better, beating people by comfortable margins."" When asked about the Iowa defense stopping fullback Joel Payton on four successive smashes from the one-yard line, the tough old general actually chuckled and said. ""Naw, I'm not perturbed. I think we can get it (the goal line offense) wound up again. We'll have to open some people up down there. We can pass down there — we don't like to but we can."" Speaking in more characteristic terms, Woody then returned to a favorite theme of his this year, the Buckeye defense, which he tc rmed ""just damn good."" His defenders intercepted ""three passes and held Hawkeye ballcarriers to only 69 yards rushing in another great performance. At the outset it appeared both defenses were trying to outdo each other as a 25-yard Ohio State field goal was the only scoring in the first quarter. As the second quarter opened, the Bucks used a 14-yard Gerald pass to Bill Jaco and runs by Ron Springs and Jeff Logan to move to the Iowa one where they had first and goal. Fullback Joel Payton. .the nation's leading scorer going into the game, rammed into the Hawkeye line four times but was stacked up each time. Payton, who had run the same play last week for four touchdowns said afterwards he felt he had scored. ""I may have been over on the second try, but I know I was over on the third."" The goal-line stand soon made little difference when the Bucks scored on their next possession. Gerald burst over left guard from the Iowa 44. embarrassed numerous would-be tacklers and sped to the end zone. Vlade Janakievski's extra point gave the Bucks a 10-0 lead. Janakievski scored again just before the half on a 28-yard field goal for a 13-0 halftime edge.

Buckeye gridders were shooting for the Rose Bowl, OSU dorms and parking lots were overflowing and freshmen had discovered bar-hopping on High Street. Blazers and leather coats were ""in,"" marijuana was the no. 1 drug on 'college campuses and a cheerleader became homecoming queen. It was Autumn Quarter, 1968, at Ohio State, two and a half years before violent, student riots forced a two-week shutdown of Ohio State. Yet the campus lifestyle reflected in 10-year-old Lanterns bears a remarkable resemblance to today's complacent col-</p><p dir=""auto"">legiate existence. Naturally, there were some noticeable differences that dated the era. Front-page headlines were made when the Ohio Union began serving 3.2 beer and the cheerleaders donned skirts seven inches above the knee. The Women's Self-Government Association scored a victory by legalizing ""overnights"" in men's apartments for junior and senior women. Simon and Garfunkel were coming to St. John Arena, ""The Graduate"" was playing at the local cinema and McDonald's hamburgers rose in price from 18 to 20 cents. A local radio station featured ""the young sound"" of Petula Clark, Herman's Hermits. The Lettermen, The Association. Sonny &amp;</p><p dir=""auto"">Cher and Gary Puckett. Students were ""doing their own thing"" in Nehru jackets, culottes, mini skirts and midi coats.

It was fun to be young.</p><p dir=""auto"">watching Jackie and Ari tie the knot, Nixon, Humphrey and Pat Paulsen race to the finish for the presidency and LBJ halt the bombings of North Vietnam. Autumn Lantern editorials often dealt with nothing more than congratulate ing the football team an4 Woody on a ""real"" victory orcommendinga fraternity for its service project. But beneath the carefree campus atmosphere, a different kind of restlessness was beginning. A closer look at period Lanterns reveals the, rumbles of dis^A satisfaction coming closer . and closer to the Pepsi generation. Tucked in among reports of sorority rush parties, sports writeups and concert reviews were a photograph of rock-throwing</p><p dir=""auto"">youths in Chicago and stories on CatholicProtestant student riots in Ireland or leftist Japanese students picketing a U.S. , air force base in Tokyo, OSU President Novice Fa wcett himself gave a hint of things to come in his welcome address to 1968 freshmen. ""Ohio State is not an arena for political action, nor a fortress from which one may defy constitutional government,"" he warned. ""We will not wil-</p><p dir=""auto"">lingly serve as a soapbox upon which exhibitionists may pose in order to direct attention to their ludicrous and often revolting selfexpression."" That autumn, the university announced its policy on demonstrations, probably in response to several rallies which had been held the spring before. ""Peaceful demonstrations outside buildings are acceptable,"" Fawcett decreed, but he also said protests within campus build-</p><p dir=""auto"">ings would automatically be considered disruptive and participants would be subject to discipline. The same Lantern issue ran another article on the back page: ""Approximately 350 students, fac-</p><p dir=""auto"">ulty and outsiders gathered on the Oval Wednesday to hear the first protest rally of the season.""

LTN19700423-01.2.45,Centennial Spending Seems Like Millions ,ARTICLE,23 April 1970,"<p dir=""auto"">Centennial Spending Seems Like Millions</p><p dir=""auto"">Appearances Are Misleading</p><p dir=""auto"">By SHIRLEY BROWNELL Lantern Staff Writer The University appears to have struck it rich in financing its Centennial Year activities . To judge from the success and caliber of the programs , one would think the University had millions to spend rather than a total budget of only $ 130 , 000 . According to Frederick Stecker , centennial coordinator , the Board of Trustees provided the University with $ 100 , 000 , taken from special funds , for the Centennial celebration . This , together with $ 30 , 000 contributed by the University ' s Development Fund , is the Centennial Committee ' s only source of revenue , Stecker said . The key to the program ' s success , Stecker believes , is the involvement of people , their enthusiasm , as well as the caliber of people on the various committees . The interest in the program is widespread , he said , attributing it , in part , to the fact that it will be "" another 100 years before we'll get a chance to do something like this . ""</p><p dir=""auto"">Stecker said $ 65 , 000 of the total budget was distributed to the various colleges which were asked to provide Centennial programs for students , faculty and alumni . Each college requesting funds and which came forward with "" an enrichment program"" was given $ 3 , 800 . he said . A similar amout was given to the Centennial Student Steering Committee for student programming , while $ 3 , 000 went to the library and $ 2 , 800 to University College for special projects , Stecker said . The remaining $ 65 , 000 has gone for publicity , Centennial signs for lampposts , 10 C Centennial citations tc replace the Distinguished Service Awards , mainten</p><p dir=""auto"">ance and contingency fund . Stecker said $ 15 , 000 was also given to the Department of Photography for production of a ""low cost "" documentary film on the University . The film was shown during Charter Weekend and has been featured on television , he added . The list of articles bearing the Centennial symbol is astounding . It includes calendars , name tags , book marks for all new library books , postage meter cancellation stamps , place mats and sugar packets for use in residence halls , letterheads as well as athletic and entertainment tickets . Another item , the Scarlet and Gray automobile license tags , were produced at no cost to the University or the Centennial Committee . Stecker explained that the University made a request to Gov . James A . Rhodes that license plates carry the</p><p dir=""auto"">colors scarlet and gray in 1970 , in recognition of Ohio State ' s Centennial year . Other Centennial projects include a pictorial history of 100 University leaders of the past . The book is being printed by the University Press and Stecker hopes sales will pay for the production cost . Also , the histories of the various departments are being updated at no cost to the Centennial Committee . Charter Weekend and other Alumni Association activities are being paid for from special revenues , Richard M . Mall , director of alumni affairs said . He estimates a final cost of $ 40 , 000 to $ 50 , 000 for the association ' s Centennial programs . Revenue has come from the sale of commemorative portraits , momemtos and from alumni - sponsored tours , Mall said . There is no tax money involved nor has the money come essentially from membership funds , he</p><p dir=""auto"">said . The association also produced commemorative medallions at an estimated cost of $ 10 , 000 . The medallion was designed by an alumnus , Milton Caniff , free of charge , Stecker said . Many were presented to outstanding alumni during Charter Weekend . The Centennial Student Steering Committee neither asked for nor received allocation from student fees , T . Rodney Swearingen , student adviser said . The group has operated solely on the $ 3 , 800 given it by the University . According to Leni Rosenfield , committee co-chair-man , the Centennibration cake cost approximately $ 500 and was paid for by an alumnus . She said aid to the student group has also come in the form of publicity , paid for by the Alumni Association . The next student-sponsored event will be the float parade during Homecoming . There is little cost involved in the float parade , Swearingen</p><p dir=""auto"">said , because the usual ""house"" decorations will be transferred to the floats . Most of the colleges have gone further , Stecker said , in seeking funds from other sources for their programs . One of the most enterprising has been the College of Education . According to D . Alexander Severino , associate dean , the College of Education has set up 11 alumni districts within Ohio and one out-of-state , to raise money . So far , more than $ 14 , 000 has been raised , Severino said , and he estimated that the final amount may reach $ 20 , 000 . The money , he said , is going towards a series of conferences sponsored by the college and towards commemorating certain issues of the college ' s quarterly magazine , ""Theory Into Practice , "" ( TIP ) to the Centennial . Rather than hold symposiums and conferences , University , College asked the Centennial Committee for $ 2 , 800 , to put together a</p><p dir=""auto"">centennial display to be used throughout the state . The display illustrates "" undergraduate learning at Ohio State over the past 100 years , "" Robert A . Barnes , director of the Newark Campus said . The display shows a lighted Centennial symbol and projects color slides of undergraduate learning , he said . Mervin G . Smith , assistant dean , hopes that part of the money given to the College of Agriculture and Home Economics will go towards a sculpture now in the planning state . The sculpture , to be set up on West Campus , will indicate past and future development , Smith said . It will pertain to agriculture , agricultural industry , rural people and food distribution in the world . The college has received other contributions , Smith said , and has raised money from registration and fees for conferences and meetings held . The College of Humanities pooled its funds with the</p><p dir=""auto"">Graduate School , now observing the 10 th Annual Conference of Humanities , in order to get better speakers . The college sponsored the University Dance Company ' s presentation of 18 th to 20 th century dance forms to ""illustrate changes the humanities have gone through in the last 100 years , "" Professor Harold J . Grimm said . The College of the Arts spent some $ 10 , 000 for the Beethoven concert during Charter Weekend , Dean Lee Rigsby said , but made it back at the box office . He believes the Jerome Lawrence-Robert E . Lee play , ""The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail , "" which premieres here April 21 , will pay for itself as did the dance concert in March . Funds given to the college by the Centennial Committee will go towards a big exhibit slated for November which will portray Ohio at the turn r pf the century , Rigsby said ,, J In addition to its $ 3 , 888 , ' t ^ e College of Optometry has re</p><p dir=""auto"">ceived $ 7 , 000 from the Sheard Foundation . Together with the Department of Ophtalmology and the Institute for Research and Vision , the college ' s activities include a centennial conference in visual science in November . Professor George E . Briggs believes activities of the College of Social and Behavioral Sciences may cost an additional $ 10 , 000 . The college plans a symposium and two conferences later this year , and Briggs believes the final cost will depend on the availability and prominence of speakers . The College of Mathematics and Physical Sciences is matching funds given it by the Centennial Committee and may underwrite certain other costs , professor Philip Jastram said . Neither the College of Law</p><p dir=""auto"">nor the College of Administrative Science have sought additional funds . According to Mrs . Kathie Dickhaut , public relations associate , half of the money given to the College of Administrative Science went toward the purchasing of Centennial Distinguished Service Awards which were given to 144 persons of the college and profession . The College of Engineering requested no funds , choosing instead to give Centennial emphasis to a project already undertaken . One of the few complaints coming out of the Centennial planning is that students have not been involved enough in some of the programs , Stecker said . Several students questioned showed little or no interest</p><p dir=""auto"">in centennial activities . Pamela Dresbach , University College-1 , said the programs hold no meaning for her because she would like to see "" more studentoriented programs rather than conferences . "" Karl Zilka , Arts-2 , said he hasn ' t given the activities a thought . He said he knows of Centennial year only because he reads about it in the Lantern . Zilka said he would like to see the University sponsor a ""big , informal anniversary party"" or something special to involve students . James Fox , Medicine-2 , said he hasn ' t heard medical students or friends of his talk about the Centennial . He blames his lack of interest on the fact that he is more concerned with studying or doing something else . There hasn ' t been much student participation except for the Centennibration , Kathy Melko , Allied Medicine-1 , said . She said the only symposiums she has heard of have not been open to students , adding that if there have been student activities they have not been</p><p dir=""auto"">publicized enough . Karen Zuga , Arts-2 , said that while having a centennial year and celebrating is good for the University , its goal should be directed , not towards a party , but to improvements . ""The University should take an in-depth look at the academic program , the University as a whole and try to improve it , "" she said . Symposiums are a good idea , Miss Zuga said , adding however , that in its Centennial year the University should look to the future and to what has to be done . She said she is uninterested in the events going on because she is more involved in getting through school and with her dormitory . Karl Gruber , University College-1 , said ""its cool that the University is celebrating its 100 th year , but it ' s getting too big . "" Gruber believes students are too busy having fun or</p><p dir=""auto"">studying to find the Centennial relevant , and he believes observing its 100 th year is "" good advertisement for the school . "" William B . Hall , Administrative Science-4 , has found the Centennial programs useful and good . The University is using the Centennial to "" see where its been in the last 100 years and where its going , "" he said . The programs are relevant to students , whether they know it or not , Hall said .</p>"
LTN19790117-01.2.18,'Animal House' frenzy no more,ARTICLE+ILLUSTRATION,17 January 1979,"<p dir=""auto"">'Animal House' frenzy no more</p><p dir=""auto"">Several years ago, a national magazine reported a quite remarkable incident as follows: ""Each morning, last January, an entire platoon of Chinese soldiers would march out on the ice, lower their trousers, and aim their buttocks toward the Soviet side of the border. This is the ultimate Chinese insult."" This episode is instructive not only about Sino-Soviet relations, but also the quiet eloquence of symbolic speech. Its lesson was not lost on either the President of the Cleveland Board of Education or the editors of National Lampoon, who produced the movie ""Animal House."" Both employed this particular gesture — the former on a public highway, for which he was assessed a fine; the latter in a movie scene, from which they are reputedly making a fortune. Whether extended by Chinese soldiers, actors depicting latter-day collegians, or, one must presume, a school board president, this irreverent greeting seems to convey a certain failure of respect for the recipient in particular and, one suspects, for civilized custom in general. This sort of irreverence was the major theme of the film, ""Animal House."" For those readers who were not moved to see this film by the extensive advertising campaign or the attention given to it by various national publications (e.g., Newsweek), for those who await with bated breath its arrival at the $1 per seat theaters, and for those simply who do not care, the film can be briefly summarized. A group of thirtyish actors depict a group of naughty but appealing post-pubescent fraternity members who are thrown together in a dilapidated house (The ""Delt House"") on a college campus in the mid-I960's. Through a series of incidents, ineluding a now widely mimicked ""toga party"" scene, they demonstrate a disinterest in matters academic, a disaffection for social mores and folkway, and a consuming desire to bring embarrassment and unhappiness to a discipline-minded dean and a group of super-straight, jock-ROTC students. The story's final scene depicts their penultimate success — the ruination of the school's homecoming parade. The script writers are then pleased</p><p dir=""auto"">to tell us that each of the film's heroes has gone on to become something respectable — such as a politician and a gynecologist. The moral of this — if one was intended — is obscure. The film's popular legacy seems to be in the wearing of togas, and the phenomenon of the toga party on campuses. , In ancient Rome, the toga was the badge of a freeborn citizen. It seems now — owing, again, to this film — to symbolize, in a manner not unlike the Chinese insult, a certain attitude of insouciance, irreverence, in a word, naughtiness. Or at least it is supposed to. But somehow this message is lost when the wearing of togas — an audacious gesture in the mid-60's setting for the movie — is earnestly encouraged by university staff members, when a ""toga party"" is sponsored by the student union. In the movie it was, well, like ""wild."" Excessive imbibing of beer, deflowering adolescent females and all — it was, in the same word, so, well, so naughty. But now the (expletive deleted) university has institutionalized toga parties. How can a party be wild or naughty if it is sponsored by the (expletive deleted) university? A whole lot of things are like that lately. One superficial view of the popularity of ""Animal House"" is that it signals a ""return"" to the values of an earlier generation of students — that students once again want only to guzzle beer, to fornicate, and to throw food at one another. (As though, somehow, these had become lost arts during the intervening years of political activism.) This is, of course, nonsense. The real key is to be found in the figure of the malevolent dean, the arch villain. Had it not been for him, the antics of the Delt House would have seemed as dull, boring, sophomoric as they really were. But the omnipresent threat of punishment and retribution, the risk of discipline — however remote and however lenient — made these exploits daring and the characters swashbuckling heroes. The plot and the character gave life — even as countless plots and characters before them — to what Carl Sandburg called the ""marvelous</p><p dir=""auto"">rebellion of man at all signs reading: 'Keep off.' "" The character Blutarski is lionized not because of his cafeteria etiquette, but ratherforhis bravura, for. thumbing his nose at convention and authority, for his, well, his naughtiness. Students today are understandably restive, morose. The thoughtless permissiveness of this and other academic institutions has taken all the fun out of naughtiness. There are so few rules left to break, so few spiteful authority figures to fear or defy. I know this to be true. My own brother is a hall director, and knows a bout such things. He assures me this is the reason for the generally unhappy morale in the residence halls. Students want to sneak off and be nasty with one another, and the university gives them 24-hour ""visitation;"" students want to sneak a sixpack of Stroh's into their rooms, and the university authorizes keg parties in the hallways; students want sinister authority figures to hate and defy, and the university gives them Barb Tootle, Wendell Ellenwood, Rich Hollingsworth, and Bill Nester. The university gives them my brother. Who could hate them? The permissiveness of today's policies has denied a whole generation of students the bittersweet bliss of stolen love out-of-doors on a cold winter's night, the flush of achievement from smuggling spiritous drink into the dorms, the self-fulfillment of thumbing one's nose at authority. The university was not always so callous and indifferent to its students' morale. Pollard's ""History of The Ohio State University"" is replete with references to student discipline — meted out Judge Roy Bean style, swift and firm. In the ""Bevis Years""</p><p dir=""auto"">for example, one reads of ""pranks"" attaining ""mob proportions."" There were even, God forbid, ""a few cases of liquor violation, ""and ""some ofthe incidents were impulsive but re- . suited in extensive damage to property and danger to others, especially co-eds who, in several instances, were not blameless in what resulted."" And finally, in Pollard's own unexpurgated prose, we read: Fortified by too much beer, it was said, three members of a fraternity - the same one that had figured in other incidents -four days before Christmas. 1951 made off with a large statue of St. Joseph and one of a sheep from a creche on the laivn adjoining St. Joseph's cathedral downtown. Somehow they managed to secrete it in the fraternity house during the holidays, although the larger statue was five feet tall and weighed 500 pounds. The culprits were identified, found guilty and sentenced as follows: they were to apologize to the Bishop, were to donate a pint of blood each to the Red Cross, were to take a course in philosophy or ethics, were not to drive a car during the Winter Quarter. were to pay the costs of repairs to the larger statue, and were to be on disciplinary probation for the remainder of the year. To cap this the fraternity suspended them, and in court they were fined $100 and costs each, with 60-day jail sentences suspended. The university did not identify them, but the court did and the judge called the trio ""illadvised smarties."" What adventure! What fun! How naughty! Today most of these events would go unnoticed. Clearly they would not achieve the dignity of mention in the History of the University. Clearly, this calamity must not be allowed to persist. I propose that U.S.G., S.W.A.N., C.S.A., O.D.U.A., and the Ohio Staters, Inc. take this matter up as their first item of business for 1979. Students need rules to break, the more arbitrary and ridiculous the better. Of course I could be wrong about all this. But if I am, it scarcely matters, for I was told this need not be a serious column anyway. Eric R. Gilbertson is the special assistant to President Harold L.
