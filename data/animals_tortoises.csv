An Abyssinian hornbill's most obvious identifying feature is its large beak, topped with a bony prominence called a casque. However, they also boast striking features including long eyelashes, distinct facial markings, a yellow mark at the base of their beaks, and long legs that help them forage. Males sport blue and red coloration on their throats and blue around their eyes, while females only have blue on their eyes and throat. Males are also normally slightly larger than females. Juveniles have brown feathers and less vibrant throat coloration.While they are able to fly, Abyssinian ground hornbills prefer to run if threatened. They will, however, fly to catch prey or defend territory.

Similar in size to a wild turkey, Abyssinian hornbills are large birds about 40 inches (102 centimeters) long and weighing up to 8 to 11 pounds (4 to 5 kilograms).

1,addax,Addax nasomaculatus,Mammalia,Artiodactyla,Bovidae,Addax nasomaculatus,"
Addax are stocky, sturdy antelopes with short, slender legs and short tails. The color of their coats varies based on the season; in the summer, their coats are white or very pale brown, while in the winter, their coats are gray, beige and even dark brown. Both males and females have short, shaggy manes, with dark patches between their long, twisted horns. They have white facial blazes that resemble an ‘x’ running between their eyes.
","
Adults weigh between 130-275 pounds (60-125 kilograms) and have a standing shoulder height of about 33 to 38 inches (85-95 centimeters). Females are typically a bit smaller than males. Their horns are long, reaching up to 28–33 inches (70–85 centimeters).

2,african-clawed-frog,Xenopus laevis,Amphibia,Anura,Pipidae,Xenopus laevis,"
An African clawed frog's body is flattened with a smaller, wedge-shaped head. The positioning of the eyes and nostrils on the top of the head, along with camouflaged skin, help this species hide from predators, such as herons. The smooth skin is often multicolored with blotches of greenish-gray or brown on its back. The underside is off-white with a yellow hue. African clawed frogs have the ability to change their appearance to match their background, becoming darker, lighter or mottled.
The frogs' front limbs are small with non-webbed fingers used to push food into the mouth. Their hind legs are large and webbed, and the three inside toes on either foot have ""claws,"" which are not true claws but cornified tips. Although an adept swimmer, the African clawed frog is clumsy on land and crawls rather than hops.
African clawed frogs also have a lateral line system that is very sensitive to vibrations, enabling them to detect predators and prey in murky water. The lateral line is visible as a series of white stitch marks along each side of the frog.
The Pipidae family of frogs is unique in that members lack a tongue and a visible ear. The males also lack vocal cords. Instead of moveable eyelids, a horny, transparent covering protects their eyes.
","
Males weigh 2 ounces (60 grams), and are about 2 to 2.5 inches (5 to 6 centimeters) long. Females are much larger, weighing approximately 7 ounces (200 grams) and are about 4 to 4.5 inches (10 to 12 centimeters) long. Females also have cloacal extensions at the end of their abdomen.

Unlike most tortoises that have hard, domed shells, the African pancake tortoise has a thin, flat shell. As a result, the shell (or carapace) does not offer much protection from predators, so pancake tortoises use speed and flexibility to evade danger.
A pancake tortoise's shell is generally different shades of brown with patterns that provide camouflage in their rocky habitat. Its plastron, or belly, is pale yellow, and its head, limbs and tail are generally yellow-brown.

                    They grow to be about 7 inches (17.8 centimeters).

There are 30 species of plated lizards, and African plated lizards (also called giant plated lizards) are one of the largest. They have thick bodies and powerful legs, which aid in both speed and digging. They have black, rubber-like balls on the soles of their feet.
Adult African plated lizards have black or brown scales on their backs, called dorsal scales. Each dorsal scale is spotted with yellow. The plates on their heads, called head shields, are also yellow. Their throats are an off-white color, and their bellies are light brown. Juveniles are black with yellow spots on their backs and yellow stripes on the sides of their bodies.
African plated lizards' dorsal scales are small with many ridges, with give them a serrated appearance. Their lower eyelids are also covered with small scales. They have large, triangular scales on their cheeks, called tympanic shields. Their abdomens are lined with rows of plates, which are specialized bones in the skin that provide support for the scales.
There are two subspecies of African plated lizards, Gerrhosauraus validus validus and Gerrhosaurus validus maltzahni. The subspecies G. v. maltzahni has 12-14 rows of plates on its abdomen, called ventral plates. Small scales, called suboculars, also border its upper lip. The subspecies G. v. validus, which is found in the eastern part of the African plated lizard's range, has 14-16 ventral plates and no suboculars on its top lip.
Plated lizards have a groove, called the “relief groove,” that runs laterally along the length of the body. The relief groove contains skin with no scales. Itallows for expansion, which helps plated lizards hide from predators. When threatened, they will run into a rocky hill and hide inside the crack of a rock. They then fill their lungs with air to wedge themselves in place.
","
                    The African plated lizard is among the largest in the plated lizard family and can grow to a maximum length of 70 centimeters (27.5 inches).

Allen's swamp monkeys are small and stout. Their fur is brown, gray and green and grows longer around the neck and shoulders than on the rest of the body. Their tails are generally longer than their bodies.

Alligator lizards range from teal blue to deep green with pale yellow bellies and a yellow ring around each eye. Males tend to be more vibrant than females, while juveniles are paler and marked with dark, lateral stripes.
The alligator lizard has a triangular head and a prehensile tail that helps them climb and navigate through treetops.

The alligator snapping turtle's defining characteristics are its large head, strong jaws and hooked beak. It has a spiked, dark-brown carapace. Alligator snapping turtles have long, narrow tongues equipped with an appendage that looks like a worm to attract prey. Algae growing on these turtles' backs lends camouflage among the muddy river beds they inhabit.

Males can weigh up to 90 kilograms (200 pounds) with a carapace length of up to 80 centimeters (31 inches).

9,alpaca,Lama pacos,Mammalia,Artiodactyla,Camelidae,Lama pacos,"
Alpacas are slender-bodied animals with long legs and necks, small heads and large, pointed ears. They are covered in a soft fleece that is virtually free of guard hair and occurs in a variety of colors. Alpacas have soft, padded feet that leave even the most delicate grasses and terrain undamaged as they graze. The two types of alpacas are huacaya and suri.
Ninety-five percent of alpacas are huacayas. Their crimpy fiber grows perpendicular to the skin, giving them a wooly appearance. Suris have straight fiber that curls toward the ground, hanging in ""dreadlocks."" However, because of their finer, less dense coat, the suri is not quite as adept at withstanding severe weather. The suri is rarer with only about 5,000 registered in the United States.
The Smithsonian's National Zoo exhibits huacaya alpaca. Alpacas have no top, front teeth. An adult male alpaca's upper and lower incisors and lower canines develop into fighting teeth or fangs that can be more than 1.2 inches (3 centimeters) long. These teeth do not develop as much in females. Aside from this difference in tooth morphology, sexual dimorphism is minimal in alpacas.

","
Alpacas are the smallest of the domesticated camelid species. Adult alpacas usually range from 100 to 200 pounds (45 to 90 kilograms). Their head and body length ranges from 47 to 85 inches (1.2 to 2.2 meters), and their tail length ranges from 6 to 10 inches (150 to 220 millimeters). Their shoulder height is typically 32 to 40 inches (0.8 to 1.1 meters). 
Huacaya alpaca have a birth weight of between 10 and 17 pounds (4.5 to 7.7 kilograms) and grow to an adult weight of between 100 and 190 pounds (45.3 to 86.1 kilograms). Adults stand 32 to 39 inches (81.2 to 99 centimeters) tall at the shoulder.
